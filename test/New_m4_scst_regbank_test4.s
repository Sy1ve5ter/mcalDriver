/******************************************************************************
* Test summary:
* -------------
*   Tests forwarding logic functionality. 
*   - Verifies that results from one instruction can be used immediately 
*     as inputs in next instructions. Values are not taken from register file 
*     but they must be forwarded.
* 
* 测试总结：
* -------------
* 测试转发逻辑功能。
* - 验证可以立即使用一条指令的结果
* 作为下一个指令的输入。 值不是从寄存器文件中获取的
* 但它们必须被转发。
