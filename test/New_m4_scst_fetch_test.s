* Test summary:
* -------------
* This test focuses on fetch unit. Here we test that code which is modified during runtime
* is correctly fetched and then executed.
*
* Overall coverage:
* -----------------
* Covers DSB, ISB instructions where DSB instruction ensures that new code is
* stored and ISB instruction ensures that this new code is fetched.
* 测试总结：
* -------------
* 此测试侧重于获取单元。 在这里，我们测试在运行时修改的代码
* 正确获取然后执行。
*
* 整体覆盖：
* -----------------
* 涵盖 DSB、ISB 指令，其中 DSB 指令可确保新代码
* 存储和 ISB 指令确保获取此新代码。
